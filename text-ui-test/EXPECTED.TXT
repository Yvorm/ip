Heya! I'm Terri.
I can log and manage a ton of different tasks - just use different keywords followed by a description to tell me what to do:
____________________________________________________________
KEYWORDS:
'todo' + (description) : logs a task with no specific due date
'deadline' + (description) + '/by (due date)' : logs a task due at a specific point in time
'event' +  (description) + '/from (start time)' + '/to (end time)' : logs an event occurring during a specified period
If I don't see one of the above keywords, I'll ask ya if you want a refresher!
____________________________________________________________
UTILITY:
'list' : Generates a list of all currently logged tasks/events, ordered oldest-newest. The number before each task is it's 'task number'
'mark' + '(task number)' : Records that a task has been completed
'unmark' + '(task number)' : Records that a task has not been completed
'delete' + '(task number)' : Deletes the indicated task from memory
